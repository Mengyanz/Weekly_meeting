### About the PRESCAL paper
* Talk about the pipelines for the PRESCAL on meeting!
* To fully understand the paper, I need to first learn (that's kind of related to how to read a paper and what kind of paper suits for me to start):
(1) Matrix Factorization (without probability) 
-> Tensor Factorization (without prob) [A Three-Way Model for Collective Learning on Multi-Relational Data](http://www.icml-2011.org/papers/438_icmlpaper.pdf) Still cofused about how to do the factorization? the regularized minimization problem? 
-> TF/MF (with prob)
(2) Gibbs Sampler [done, where I found the tutorial [Gibbs sampling for Bayesian linear regression in Python](https://kieranrcampbell.github.io/blog/2016/05/15/gibbs-sampling-bayesian-linear-regression.html) is interesting] -- But not fully understand why it works (why sampling based on only conditional probability can generate "true" values)
(3) Thompson Sampling 
(4) Compositional relations
* For code, have downloaded the datasets (e.g.nation) and process the data a little bit

### About the Knowledge graph refinement paper

I wrote note for it, if interested please see [notes for KGF paper](https://github.com/Mengyanz/Paper_notes/blob/master/KG_Refinement.md)
